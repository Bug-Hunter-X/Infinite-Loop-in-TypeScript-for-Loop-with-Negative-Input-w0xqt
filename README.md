This repository demonstrates a common error in TypeScript: an infinite loop caused by using a negative number in a for loop's condition. The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises when a negative number is passed as input; the loop condition `i <= n` never evaluates to false, leading to an infinite loop. The solution involves adding a check to handle negative input values.
